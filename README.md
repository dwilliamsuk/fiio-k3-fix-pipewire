# Fix for FiiO K3 auto power-off on Systemd Distros

The FiiO K3 has an auto power-off "feature" or low power mode which disables it when there is no audio signal keeping it alive.
It will make an audible click every time a new sound is played, like a notification.
The sound gets cut off because of the startup delay which can be annoying.

This workaround fixes the auto power off "feature" by constantly playing null audio via `ffplay`. You will need `ffmpeg` installed.

All credit to [Richard Kuhnt](https://github.com/r15ch13) for making these scripts. Very little adaptation was required from myself to get this
working with pipewire.

## How it works

1. The udev rule triggers if the FiiO K3 is added/removed from the system and executes the script `fiio-k3-fix`.
2. The script will try to get the current user running `pipewire` and start or stop the service accordingly.
3. The service runs `ffplay` to constantly play null audio which keeps the FiiO K3 alive.

## Install

Disconnect the FiiO K3 and run the following commands to install the fix.

```bash
# add service
cp fiio-k3-fix.service ~/.config/systemd/user

# enable service
systemctl --user enable fiio-k3-fix.service

# udev script
sudo cp fiio-k3-fix /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fiio-k3-fix

# add udev rule
sudo cp 91-fiio-k3-added.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

# reload rules
sudo udevadm control --reload
```

## Testing

Connect the FiiO K3 again and turn it on. The service status should now show `ffplay` running.

```bash
systemctl --user status fiio-k3-fix.service
```

```bash
$ systemctl --user status fiio-k3-fix.service
